			<h2>Rollings Middle School of the Arts</h2>
			<p>Establishing admissions through an audition process, Rollings Middle School of the Arts features six fine arts "cores," or specialties:  Dance, Theatre, Visual Arts, Vocal, Piano, and Strings. Each student auditions for a core of their choice and will, upon admission, spend three hours each day in their core course. Along with the core, RMSA's academic curriculum includes rigorous courses in each of the distributional subjects: Math, Science, Social Studies, and Language Arts.</br><br> At Rollings, Amy enrolled in the Strings core, auditioning on the piano, which she has studied since the age of five. In her three years there, Amy was elected to Student Council and served as a Student Ambassador. She received the awards of Overall Student of the Year, Science Student of the Year, and Social Studies Student of the Year.
