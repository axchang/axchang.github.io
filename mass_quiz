Why is line 3 necessary? What happens without it?
    There would literally be no instance/ no instantiation of the variable you're trying to create. You wouldn't be able to see it later.
Is Christian a subclass or a superclass?
   subclass
What will running Christian.go_to_mass do? Why?
   It will crash becuase you can't/shouldn't call a method on a class.
What will running abdullah.sect do? Why? If you think it's broken, how can you fix it? If you think it works, what does it return?
    Technically, will throw an error. Could create an accessor because sect isn't actually a method.
What is abdullah? Choose all that apply:
  A class
  A method
  An instance
  An object
  A variable

  It is an instance, an object, and a variable
